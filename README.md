Raumserver is a webserver which is used to control the Raumfeld Multiroom System via http requests. It can be installed on raumfeld devices with the help of an installer (not ready yet) or it can be installed manually on several architectures and operating systems where there are nodeJs binaries for.

## Getting started
Before starting make sure your Raumfeld system has Spotify's multiroom mode enabled even if you have only one speaker. [Otherwise raumserver won't fully work](https://github.com/ChriD/node-raumserver/issues/36). To do so, open the Raumfeld app on your mobile device. Click the three dashes on the upper left corner, select **Spotify** and next to **MULTIROOM MODE** shift the switch to On, so it gets orange colored.
